         <summary>1.how does reforestation help planet?</summary><br>
         <b class="text">Since the beginning of the 20th century, the world’s forests have 
    lost about 20% of their coverage. According to the United Nations’ Food and 
    Agriculture Organization, about 7.3 million hectares (18 million acres) of forest
    are lost every year, and roughly half of Earth’s tropical forests
    have already been cleared.<br>

    SAGE.ORG recognizes that planting billions of trees across the world is one of the biggest and cheapest ways of taking CO2 out of the 
    atmosphere to tackle the climate crisis. Not only do forests act as carbon sinks, but they also provide vital habitat for animals and ecological 
    services for humans, such as purifying the air we breathe and regulating local temperatures.<br>

    Responsible reforestation programs can stabilize land from erosion or natural disasters, improve soil health and groundwater recharge, promote native
    and endemic fauna, and provide economic development for nearby communities.<br>

    SAGE.ORG understands that reforestation is one of the most important and accessible ways that people can contribute to solving the challenges of
    climate change and is committed to continuing The woods and jays Project and investing in responsible reforestation programs internationally.</b>

         <summary>2.How do we plant?</summary><br>
         <b class="text"> Our planting locations are selected to have a direct and positive impact on areas affected by climate change. We work hard 
             to ensure our programs also benefit 
    the people and communities who live near the new trees, and often plant tree species that produce fruit, nuts, or other resources that help people.<br>

    Our projects typically include the growing of saplings in nurseries for 6-12 months before planting, as well as pruning and maintenance of trees for
     the first couple of years of their lives. This helps us maximize the number of trees that survive to maturity. In most cases, nursery and maintenance 
     staff are local workers who gain valuable skills that help them serve as responsible stewards of the restored habitat.<br>

    SAGE.ORG will also partner with technical organizations and government agencies near planting sites to provide forestry and maintenance training to 
    local workers, allowing them to gain valuable skills to continue reforestation projects.</b>

         <summary>3.where does sage plant?</summary><br>
         <b class="text">SAGE.ORG has planted trees for nearly 20 years, with plantings located on every continent except Antarctica. Currently, our planting
              locations are focused in the Mt. Elgon region of Uganda, foothills of the Himalayas in India, forests near Sierra Gorda in Mexico, and a recent project 
              now underway in Madagascar.<br>
    We are always on the lookout for planting locations and partners who are committed to responsible reforestation programs. If you would like to see more of our
    planting locations,  </b>

         <summary>4.How does SAGE.ORG select its planting location?</summary><br>
         <b class="text">With so many areas of the world in need of reforestation, SAGE.ORG has to consider many factors when selecting a single location for plantings. 
     After a thorough investigation to ensure that on-the-ground planters can report accurately on projects, we consider the following factors:<br>
     <ul type="disc">
       <li> Urgency to protect biodiversity</li><br>
       <li> Threats to the location from climate change or environmental disasters</li><br>
       <li> Development of the local community</li><br>
        <li>Cost-effectiveness and accessibility</li></ul><br>
       On top of these factors, we must consider the long-term impacts of reforestation at our locations. We try our best to support and grow our planting projects
      over multiple years, and rely on trained staff to continue stewarding reforested land and to look for new projects in the area that would conserve biodiversity 
      and uplift communities..</b>

         <summary>5.How much does it cost to plant a tree?</summary><br>
         <b class="text">Tree planting costs vary by location with planting in developed countries such as the U.S. typically more expensive. For The woods and jays Project, SAGE.ORG usually 
 can plant one tree for every $1 donated. This dollar covers the purchase of materials, time spent growing in nurseries, long-term maintenance, as well as operating 
 costs that allow us to carry out and expand our program.</b>

         <summary>6.Do we collab?</summary><br>
         <b class="text">Of course! Tree planting is a critical activity that can help businesses achieve their SDGs and contributes to your corporate responsibility and sustainable leadership.
 And it’s a good thing to do!<br>

If you are representing a company interested in planting trees with SAGE.ORG, or wish to work on a special project with us, please email sponsorship@SAGE.org
